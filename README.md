# Lahman-Baseball-Database-Analysis in MySQL
This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Lahman Baseball Database using MySQL. The goal is to better understand the history of MLB, individual players, trends, team spending patterns, and how the league has changed.

### Project Description
The analysis is organized into five categories:
  * Hitting Analysis: Batting distributions, left/right/switch hitting percentages, batting averages, and on-base metrics.
  * Player Analysis: Career length, debut age, longevity by decade, and overall player trends.
  * Salary Analysis: Team payroll milestones, yearly spending trends, first year each franchise reached $1B cumulative spend, and identifying the top-spending teams (e.g., top 20% by average annual payroll).
  * School & Geography Analysis: Player birthplace, colleges attended, and geographic impact on the MLB.
  * Team Analysis: Franchise-level performance patterns, roster composition, and multi-season trends.

#### Files
create_db: SQL code that create the date structure and database
data: SQL code to input date into the database tables
csv_data: the data used in the analysis in csv form
data_analysis_queries: The queries I used for EDA

#### Dependencies
Any version of SQL. Its a lot of data so excel will likely be slow. There is also a lot of incomplete rows so some data cleaning and/or filtering is needed
