# Lahman-Baseball-Database-Analysis in MySQL
This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Lahman Baseball Database using MySQL. The goal is to better understand the history of MLB, individual players, trends, team spending patterns, and how the league has changed.

### Project Description
The analysis is organized into five categories:
  * Hitting Analysis: Batting distributions, left/right/switch hitting percentages, batting averages, and on-base metrics.
  * Player Analysis: Career length, debut age, longevity by decade, and overall player trends.
  * Salary Analysis: Team payroll milestones, yearly spending trends, first year each franchise reached $1B cumulative spend, and identifying the top-spending teams (e.g., top 20% by average annual payroll).
  * School & Geography Analysis: Player birthplace, colleges attended, and geographic impact on the MLB.
  * Team Analysis: Franchise-level performance patterns, roster composition, and multi-season trends.

#### Dependencies
* MySQL: Any SQL will work with syntax adjustments
* Excel: For CSV import in Workbench, or other tools

##### Note: The Dataset is large and will be slow if used in Excel. Filtering or cleaning is required to get rid of incomplete rows or false data.

#### Purpose
I did this project for the following reasons:
 * To strengthen querying skills in SQL
 * Generate real date and gain insights into the history of baseball
