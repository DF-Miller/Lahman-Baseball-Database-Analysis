# Lahman-Baseball-Database-Analysis in MySQL
This is an EDA of the Lahman Basball Database using MySQL. This project was done with the goal of learning more about the history of baseball, the players, their careers, and how the game and league have changed over time.

### Project Description
I grouped my queries into five categories: hitting_analysis, player_analysis, salary_analysis, school&geography_analysis, and team_analysis. The queries cover things like what % of players bat lefty, right, and switch, what was the first year each team's cumulative spending reached 1 billion USD, who are the top 20% of teams in average annual spending, average length of career by decade, etc. 

#### Files
create_db: SQL code that create the date structure and database
data: SQL code to input date into the database tables
csv_data: the data used in the analysis in csv form
data_analysis_queries: The queries I used for EDA

#### Dependencies
Any version of SQL. Its a lot of data so excel will likely be slow. There is also a lot of incomplete rows so some data cleaning and/or filtering is needed
